\item How do you compute the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for a parametric curve defined by $x(t)$ and $y(t)$?

\item Why is the formula $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$ valid, and what assumption is required about $\frac{dx}{dt}$?

\item How do you find the equation of the tangent line to a parametric curve at a specific value $t=t_0$?

\item How can you determine where a parametric curve has a horizontal tangent?

\item How can you determine where a parametric curve has a vertical tangent?

\item What happens to $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$?

\item How do you handle curves that are traced more than once when computing area?

\item How can you determine whether a parametric curve is traced once or multiple times?

\item How do you compute the surface area generated by revolving a parametric curve about the $x$-axis?

\item What is the formula $S = 2\pi \int_a^b y(t)\sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2},dt$ and when is it used?
