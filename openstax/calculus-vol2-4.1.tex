\item What is meant by a solution to a differential equation?

\item How can you verify that a function $y=f(x)$ is a solution to a given differential equation?

\item Give an example of a differential equation and one of its solutions.

\item Why are solutions to differential equations often not unique?

\item What property of derivatives explains the non-uniqueness of solutions?

\item What is the order of a differential equation?

\item How do you determine the order of a differential equation from its expression?

\item What is the order of the differential equation $y' - 4y = x^2 - 3x + 4$?

\item What is the order of the differential equation $x^2 y''' - 3x y'' + x y' - 3y = \sin x$?

\item What is a general solution of a differential equation?

\item Why does a general solution typically include an arbitrary constant $C$?

\item For the differential equation $y' = 2x$, what is its general solution?

\item What does the family of functions $y = x^2 + C$ represent?

\item What is an initial-value problem?

\item How does an initial condition help determine a unique solution?

\item Solve the initial-value problem:
  \[

  \]

\item What is the difference between a general solution and a particular solution?

\item What does it mean for a function to satisfy a differential equation?

\item Verify that $y = e^{-3x} + 2x + 3$ is a solution of
  \[
    y' + 3y = 6x + 11.
  \]

\item Verify that $y = 2e^{3x} - 2x - 2$ is a solution of
  \[
    y' - 3y = 6x + 4.
  \]

\item When checking a solution, why must both $y$ and its derivatives be substituted into the equation?

\item Can two different functions be solutions to the same differential equation? Explain why.

\item What role does the constant $C$ play geometrically in the family of solutions?

\item How would the graph of $y = x^2 + C$ change as $C$ varies?
